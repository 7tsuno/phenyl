# Development
## Preparing environment for development
1. Fork, then clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies
3. Prepare monorepo settings

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phenyl.git
```

### Install the dependencies
```bash
cd phenyl
yarn
```

After the command, all the external/interal dependencies are resolved at every module.

## Testing

After preparing monorepo settings, run the test to make sure your environment is normally built.

```bash
npm test
```
When your test failed, in most cases it's because you don't have `mongod` command.
Install it like the following way and retry the test.

```bash
# This example is for Mac users
brew update
brew install mongodb
```

## Lint
To run linting using ESLint:

```bash
yarn lint
```

## Compilation

```
yarn build
```

This command generates `lib/**/*.js` and `lib/**/*.d.ts` from `src/**/*.ts`.

## Release

**Must be a member of the npm organization's `phenyl-release-members` team.**

```
npm whoami # Print your npm account that has already joined organization
git checkout master
yarn bootstrap && yarn build
yarn run publish
```
